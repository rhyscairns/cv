    description:
      "The best way I can explain this is that I don't see being a software engineer as just a jobâI see it as problem-solving for another job. Every piece of code we write is built upon an underlying role or industry that we need to understand first. For example, if you are a software engineer at an airline company, you can't just write codeâyou need to understand aviation systems and processes. The same applies if you are developing software for a hospital; you need to grasp medical workflows and patient care. Even in sports technology, understanding performance analytics or athlete tracking is key. That's what I love about being a software engineer: the opportunity to continuously learn about different fields and industries.",
